usage.generateTools=Generate utility classes as source code. If you say "no" here, you will have to add the plugin JAR \
  to the runtime classpath of the generated class domain.
usage.usage=Usage
usage=Generates Cloneable JAXB classes. Optionally, copy constructor and partial clone functionality can be generated.
usage.options=Options
usage.narrow=Uses copy constructors for all child nodes in the object tree as long as they are available. This \
  will cause the new instance to be as narrow as possible to the declared types.\nAbstract types and types not generated \
  from this XSD-modle will always be copied by their "clone()"-method.
usage.partialClone=Generates an additional 'clone'-method and copy-constructor (if constructors are to generated at all) \
  that takes a PropertyPath instance to restrict the copy operation to selected nodes in the object tree.
