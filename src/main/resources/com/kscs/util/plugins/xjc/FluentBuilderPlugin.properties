usage.fluentBuilderGenerateTools=Generate utility classes as source code. If you say "no" here, you will have to add the plugin JAR \
  to the runtime classpath of the generated class domain.
usage=Generates an inner fluent builder for JAXB classes. Optionally, copy constructor and partial clone functionality can be generated.
usage.narrow=Uses copy constructors for all child nodes in the object tree as long as they are available. This \
  will cause the new instance to be as narrow as possible to the declared types.\nAbstract types and types not generated \
  from this XSD-modle will always be copied by their "clone()"-method.
usage.copyPartial=Generates an additional 'copyOf'-method  \
  that takes a PropertyTree instance to restrict the copy operation to selected nodes in the object tree.
usage.generateTools=Generate utility classes as static source code artifacts. If no, the plugin JAR must be in compile- and runtime classpath.
error.builderClassExists=Class "{0}" already contains inner class "Builder". Skipping generation of fluent builder.
