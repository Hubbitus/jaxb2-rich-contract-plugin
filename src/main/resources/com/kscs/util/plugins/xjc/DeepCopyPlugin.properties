defaultConstructor.bodyComment=Generated by copy-constructor plugin, JAXB requires public no-arg constructor.
copyConstructor.javadoc.desc=Instantiates a {0} copying the state of another {0}
copyConstructor.javadoc.param.other=The original {0} from which to copy state.
copyConstructor.javadoc.param.propertyPath=A restricting '{'@link PropertyPath'}' that defines which nodes of the source object tree should actually be copied.
copyConstructor.javadoc.exception=If parts or all of the source object tree cannot be copied.
usage.generateTools=Generate utility classes as source code. If you say "no" here, you will have to add the plugin JAR \
  to the runtime classpath of the generated class domain.
usage=Generates Copyable JAXB classes. Optionally, copy constructor and partial copy functionality can be generated.
usage.constructor=Generates a copy constructor on each of the classes generated from the current XSD model.
usage.narrow=Uses copy constructors for all child nodes in the object tree as long as they are available. This \
                           will cause the new instance to be as narrow as possible to the declared types.
usage.partial=Generates an additional 'createCopy'-method and copy-constructor (if constructors are to generated at all) \
  that takes a PropertyTree instance to restrict the copy operation to selected nodes in the object tree.
